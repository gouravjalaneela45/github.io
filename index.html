            <p class="intro-text">
                Let me share my thoughts on Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodologies! While exploring 
                <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-life-cycle-sdlc/" target="_blank">different SDLC approaches</a>, 
                I've discovered some fascinating methods that really stand out. Through my journey in software development, 
                I've found that certain methodologies work better in different situations. Here's my personal take on the 
                ones I find most interesting and practical, along with real-world examples from my experience:
            </p>

            <div class="question-section">
                <div class="question-item">
                    <label for="methodology-a">A) Waterfall Model - The Sequential Approach:</label>
                    <textarea id="methodology-a" rows="4" class="methodology-textarea">According to my opinion, the Waterfall Model is most ideal for those projects that have static and clearly defined requirements. Since it is logically sequential, once one phase is done, the next starts making it well organized and easier to manage. But I still feel the system has somewhat rigidity, especially during some unanticipated changes that may affect developments.</textarea>
                </div>

                <div class="question-item">
                    <label for="methodology-b">B) Agile - The Flexible Approach:</label>
                    <textarea id="methodology-b" rows="4" class="methodology-textarea">Agile, in my perception, stands tall because of its flexibility, i.e., breaking a project into parts and regular feedback and adjustments done. This seems so useful for projects being revised as needed over time. Further, it encourages teamwork and continuous improvement in my opinion efforts to get the best results possible.</textarea>
                </div>

                <div class="question-item">
                    <label for="methodology-c">C) RAD (Rapid Application Development) - The Speed-Driven Approach:</label>
                    <textarea id="methodology-c" rows="4" class="methodology-textarea">Rapid Application Development (RAD), in my perception, stands out due to its focus on speed and efficiency, emphasizing quick iterations and user feedback. This approach is particularly useful for projects that require rapid delivery and evolving requirements. By prioritizing prototype development and iterative testing, RAD allows teams to adapt quickly to user needs and changes, ensuring the final product is aligned with expectations.

                <div class="question-item">
                    <label for="methodology-d">D) Incremental Model - The Progressive Approach:</label>
                    <textarea id="methodology-d" rows="4" class="methodology-textarea">Incremental Development, in my perception, is notable for its systematic approach of breaking a project into smaller, manageable increments that are developed and tested individually. This method allows for early detection and correction of issues, making it particularly useful for complex projects with evolving requirements. By delivering functional parts of the system progressively, it ensures that feedback can be integrated continuously, enhancing the overall quality of the product. Additionally, it promotes steady progress and allows teams to adjust priorities and features based on real-time insights, fostering a flexible and adaptive development environment.</textarea>

                <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_agile_model.htm" target="_blank">Agile methodologies</a> 
                offer particularly effective approaches to modern software development. While each SDLC methodology has its merits, 
                I've found several Agile frameworks especially valuable for their adaptability and efficiency. Here are my insights 
                on some key Agile methods that I believe are particularly impactful:

                Through my web development journey, I've extensively used 
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</a> 
                to enhance the visual appeal and user experience of web applications. Here's my understanding 
                of CSS implementation approaches and their significance:

                    <label for="css-a">a) Inline CSS - Direct Styling:</label>
                    <textarea id="css-a" rows="4" class="methodology-textarea">From my experience, inline CSS provides immediate styling through the style attribute in HTML elements. While I find it useful for quick prototypes or testing, I've learned that it's best used sparingly. The main drawback I've encountered is that it mixes content with presentation, making maintenance challenging for larger projects. Example: &lt;p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;"&gt;Text content&lt;/p&gt;</textarea>
                </div>

                <div class="question-item">
                    <label for="css-b">b) Internal CSS - Embedded Styling:</label>
                    <textarea id="css-b" rows="4" class="methodology-textarea">In my development practice, I've found internal CSS useful for single-page websites. By placing styles within &lt;style&gt; tags in the HTML head section, it keeps styles organized within the document. However, I've realized its limitations when working on multi-page sites, as styles can't be reused efficiently across pages. Example: &lt;style&gt; p { color: blue; } &lt;/style&gt;</textarea>
                </div>

                <div class="question-item">
                    <label for="css-c">c) External CSS - Separate Stylesheet:</label>
                    <textarea id="css-c" rows="4" class="methodology-textarea">Through my projects, I've come to strongly prefer external CSS for its maintainability and scalability. By keeping styles in separate .css files, I can manage them more effectively and ensure consistency across multiple pages. I particularly value how it enables browser caching and makes updates easier. Example: &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;</textarea>
